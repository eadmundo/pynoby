# Pynoby #

Pynoby (**Py**thon-**no**de-ru**by**) is an experiment in parallel development of the same web application in [python](http://www.python.org/), [node](http://nodejs.org/) and [ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/).

## Principles ##

Pynoby tries to use the equivalent setup and modules in each language: virtualised environment, managed dependencies and a lightweight framework.

## Why? ##

I spend most of my time using [python](http://www.python.org/) and [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/). I thought it would be valuable to learn how equivalent things were done (properly) in the other two languages.

## Current Version ##

    0.0.3 With the Grain Templates

## Virtualisation and Dependency Management ##

[Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com/) is used to manage server-level dependencies for each language, including package management, virtualisation and dependencies. It also forwards the appropriate http ports for each app to your host machine.

### Python ###

* [pip](http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/index.html)
* [virtualenv](http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/index.html)

### Node ###

* [npm](http://npmjs.org/)
* [nave](https://github.com/isaacs/nave/)

### Ruby ###

* [rvm](https://rvm.io/)
* [Bundler](http://gembundler.com/)

## Framework and Templating ##

Framework choice was driven by the requirement to be lightweight (so no [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) or [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/), as wonderful as they might be!). Initially the idea was that template engine choice would be driven by a requirement to be able to write plain html in the templates, so no [HAML](http://haml.info/)-style templates, thanks!

But in fact mature Django-style template engines for Ruby are thin on the ground, and anyway that wouldn't really be learning properly. The template engines are now "with the grain" for each framework.

### Python ###

* [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)
* [Jinja](http://jinja.pocoo.org/) (Jinja is included in Flask by default)

### Node ###

* [Express](http://expressjs.com/)
* [Jade](http://jade-lang.com)

### Ruby ###

* [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/)
* [Haml](http://haml.info)

## Installation ##

Make sure you have [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com/) installed.

Clone the repo and create the vagrant box:

    $ git clone git@github.com:eadmundo/pynoby.git
    $ cd pynoby
    $ vagrant up

Wait until vagrant has done its thing, then:

    $ vagrant ssh

`vagrant ssh` should deliver you into `/vagrant` on the vagrant box, ready to try the web apps out. Some of the install steps below take a while to complete (especially `nave install`).

### Flask app ###

    $ cd /vagrant/python_pynoby
    $ virtualenv venv
    $ ./venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
    $ ./venv/bin/python app.py

You should be able view the Flask app by browsing to [http://0.0.0.0:5000/](http://0.0.0.0:5000/) on your host machine.

### Express app ###

    $ cd /vagrant
    $ nave install 0.8.4
    $ nave use 0.8.4
    $ cd /vagrant/node_pynoby
    $ npm install
    $ node app.js

You should be able view the Express app by browsing to [http://0.0.0.0:3000/](http://0.0.0.0:3000/) on your host machine.

### Sinatra app ###

    $ cd /vagrant/ruby_pynoby
    $ rvm install 1.9.3
    $ rvm --default use 1.9.3
    $ bundle install
    $ ruby app.rb

You should be able view the Sinatra app by browsing to [http://0.0.0.0:4567/](http://0.0.0.0:4567/) on your host machine.

## Notes ##

I found [this blog post](http://gillesfabio.com/blog/2011/03/01/rvm-for-pythonistas-virtualenv-for-rubyists/) really helpful.
